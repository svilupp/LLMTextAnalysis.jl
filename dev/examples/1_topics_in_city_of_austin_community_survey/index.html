Quit squandering our tax dollars trying to fix things that are not basic public service.","Affordability and transportation","I encourage density and avoiding sprawl but I don't see the infrastructure or strategy to support it. The bus route changes actually turned out worse for me and I stopped riding the bus, the construction doesn't seem to be strategic and there are multiple buildings being built on one stretch of road leading me to drive through one construction site after another - it doesn't feel like a pleasant city to live in when you feel like you live in a construction site... \nIt feels like buildings are evaluated case by case without thinking about other things that are going on in the neighborhood. A very large condo building (300+ units) is going up right where a bus stop USED to be - and now the new bus stop is a 10-12min walk away. I imagine residents may have used that bus stop if it had stayed there...","Maintain basic services and quit wasting time on issues you have no authority.","I am interested in having lots of really great future neighbors and friends here in Austin. In order for that to happen we need to focus on our schools. \nI know the city shies away from dealing with AISD but we may need to start a conversation soon.  Our special education aids that work directly with all of our mentally and physically impaired children make less per hour than our lifeguards at our city pools. Neither of which are a living wage. Teachers are paid less than retail store managers. By ignoring this problem we are screwing ourselves in the long run. \nWe have to take the brunt of making ends meet off of teachers and aids plates so they may focus all of their efforts on guiding our future residents to be the best citizens they can be. \nAISD seems broken to me right now and we need to fix it quickly! \nThanks for letting me get my two cents out! \nForever in love with the ATX,\nMelissa Bowman","It may be time to stop the rapid growth until the area has an infrastructure plan for current and near term population. The city is large enough that there is a serious lack of non-laughable public transportation, especially for people living south.","Think further ahead.

TAXES AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING","PLEASE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AUSTIN PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND THE ARTS.","REDUCE POPULATION GROWTH RATE, TOO MUCH TRAFFIC","DECISION MAKING AND PLANNING IN THE CITY HAS BECOME TOO SHORT SIGHTED. NEED A FAR SIGHTED VISION TO PRESERVE WHAT STILL SPECIAL ABOUT THIS CITY.","We need a comprehensive plan/vision for managing the growth of this city!","Mental health is real, our facilities are substandard and are not recommended by local professionals, and someone needs to be accountable. These people need real help, not just a band aide and to end up on the streets.","Concentrate on doing a great job at basic services.","Less focus on growth and bringing in new businesses.  Stick to a reasonable budget.  Improve infrastructure for vehicles.","Don't punish supervisors just because they didn't spend ALL the money they budgeted in the FY. The comment I was told was, Since you didn't use it you don't need it all so I'm cutting your budget.","Invest more in our teachers and education system in Austin.","Get a mobile office and travel the city. They could be exposed to real time problems while continuing to work with digital communication. This would speed up solutions.","FOCUS ON FUNCTIONS CITY EXISTS TO PROVIDE.","Please put in place a green energy program for residential home owners to switch to 100% renewable energy.","Audit the books .

I have no choice but to ask myself how does the treatment  residents in my neighborhood compare to the treatment of residence in more affluent neighborhoods.  Respectfully yours, Maria Elsa Rodriguez, 36-year resident at Copperfield subdivision","To ensure people all across this city are treated equally.  \n I live in Southeast Austin near  William Cannon and McKinney Falls Parkway and have made at least two requests to 311 over the past year to have my street repaired and the request has been ignored.\nI house sat for a friend last week that lives near Mopac and 32nd St. and called 311 requesting a pothole in the street to be repaired around 11:45 AM.   When I arrived back at her house at 5:00 PM that VERY SAME DAY,  that pothole and a couple of others were repaired.","Make sure that the camping everywhere in the streets ordice is revalued. Downtown is turning into an unhospitable street jungle full of unemployed, drug users that create waste and are unsafe to the other citizens paying the taxes. \nStop talking about affordable housing and actually create some.

But discount rates for them to use 130 .","Homeless situation in Downtown is hideous and needs to be addressed urgently. They do need to be removed from Downtown.","More lighting at night on highway 71 heading toward Bee Caves.","We need light rail or mono rail something new instead of buses which causes some of the traffic congestion.  Gondolas or something similar  running along IH35 would eliminate some traffic problems and would be unique to Austin!!!","Take bikes and scooter off of the road. Less bars in our neighborhoods.","NEED EFFICIENT TRANSIT SERVICE.","Look at creating a Truck Route starting out in Buda and ending in Sunset City to lower traffic on I-35 from 18 wheelers giving discounts to use it and if caught in city with a drop get fine .","SCOOTERS ARE GETTING IN THE WAY OF TRAFFIC AND PEDESTRIAN FLOW. THEY SHOW NO RESPECT FOR DRIVERS OR WALKERS. PUT THAT MONEY TO BETTER CITY TRANSPORTATION.","Build another airport like Houston and DFW area.","Make downtown safer at night.

Offer public transportation like trains, subway, street car.","I wish rail fees were less and more service on Sunday but I don't know how to fix that... the use of tolls during peak are unbelievably high but I know if less they would be super crowded so I have not suggestions I would pay something extra in my taxes to cover for more affordable transportation and housing there are so many apartments and not enough homes.. kids shouldn't live in Apts their whole lives","LARGER AND MORE PARKING AREAS FOR PUBLIC PARKING.","Code in dove springs so many cars parked all over a house ... makes neighborhood look bad","MORE AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE PARKING","WE NEED TO PLACE MORE EMPHASIS ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AS THE CITY GROWS IS CRITICAL THAT OUR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION GROWS AS WELL I FEEL LIKE WE ARE AT LEAST 10 YEARS BEHIND WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION","HIGH COST OF PROPERTY TAXES.

Please thank you","Please encourage services growth on east side for families.","We need better sidewalks and lighting in neighborhood.","Sanction those who blow leaves and trimmings in to the street. Create ways to accelerate traffic flow on Lamar and Airport interception.","Better ways to understand the bus or public transportation. Try to work with better service or options for the homeless.

I was reelected in 2016 but because of a better job offer in Austin, I had to move here.","Get street lights on Boulder in 78726 up to city Standards please.","Light rail.","I WOULD URGE YOU TO CREATE MORE AWARENESS AROUND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION ONCE WE HAVE MORE OV IT, IT CAN REDUCE TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS AND DUI/DWI THE TIMELINE FOR CONSTRUCTED MORE ROADS IS WAY FURTHER AWAY THAN VS CREATING MORE BUS ROUTES/BIKE ROUTES","Start using tax money for improved transportation options and remedies for the homeless problem.

Allowing the open camping is causing safety issues, and litter issues. There is a routine homeless camp behind my home for years. Previously we have been able to clean out these camps to try to keep this water runoff critical area clear. I am worried about the effects of flooding (due to trash clogged creeks) and where this litter (including used needles) will run into. My cousin was assaulted before sunset downtown after leaving dinner over not handing over his phone to a homeless man. I don't vote against ballot initiatives to aid the homeless population.

Also allowing the homeless ordice to change prior to having a solution was so incredibly short sides and not what the people wanted makes us mistrust your intent.","Mr. Mayor, while I'm sure your intentions are good, authorizing and endorsing homeless camps is bad policy, and is not any kind of acceptable solution to the city's homeless problem.  It is an abdication of responsibility, both to the individuals living in such conditions, and to the communities you serve, which deserve to be kept both safe and pleasant.  The nearby greenbelt area (Country Club Greenbelt), which should be a community jewel, is instead overrun with homeless encampments, and now, the city and parks officials who formerly worked with our community association to (humanely) remove and clean up homeless encampments say there is nothing they can do, because of the change in city policy.  The city is spending tens of millions to build paths from the area to Ladybird Lake; meantime, we can't get the city to remove mountains of trash, dangerous needles, and tent cities from the greenbelt and its paths and waterways.  Most of the well-intentioned but misguided policies the city has adopted to deal with the homeless problem are eerily similar to the failed policies of California and the Pacific Northwest, which area of the country we left for Austin, wrongly thinking that Texans had better common sense.  You should expect the same bad results.\nI have heard the Mayor say that he wants the city's homeless policies to be a model for other cities, to which I say, \"What policies?\"  The city is building a trivial amount of beds, slowly, and at great cost.  The few facilities you have in place are grossly inadequate and unsafe.  You need to partner with the private sector and let them build larger facilities, faster and cheaper than the city can, without all the red tape, aka San Diego tent breaks, which I'm sure you've heard of.  I realize there are no easy answers to these questions, but the city is moving in the wrong direction of endorsing community blighting encampments rather than addressing the homeless issue in any kind of effective way.  Recognize that when the only community input you seek on these homeless issues is 1-3 minute snippets at endless city council meetings, you are hearing from the extreme left, and not the regular citizens who must work during these marathon meetings, but who live and work in these communities, hold a very different point of view, and suffer the consequences of these misguided policies.  Unfortunately, a political environment has been created whereby any citizen who doesn't concur with the extreme left on issues of this nature, is treated with extreme disrespect in city forums, and, sadly, the Austin city council members tolerate it.  That is not democracy.  We all are legitimate voices in this city and ought to be able to work respectfully with one another towards solutions on homelessness and everything else this great city needs.","Stop wasting tax payer money on his ridiculous initiatives that only hurt the citizens of this city.","Be prudent stewards of tax dollars.","Focus on fixing the homeless problem, and STOP allowing the tent city to grow, before it completely destroys the downtown Austin area.","Fix your property tax issue, you have plenty of new people moving to Austin daily, you don't need to gauge your residents.\nDeal with the homeless, shame on you for putting the problem on everyone else, you wanted the job, now do the job.

Most overpasses in the city look like homeless camps, and there seems to be a panhandler at almost every traffic light.  I've stopped visiting major cities in California because they have gotten so disgusting, and seldom go downtown at night now for the same reason.  I am sympathetic to the plight of the homeless and am fully supportive of providing shelters to help them get cleaned up and off the streets.  But we have gone too far in allowing downtown to get overrun, just like San Francisco, San Jose, etc.  Eventually, people will no longer feel safe to go downtown, or the urine and feces will drive them away.  The City needs to develop a spine and take measures to make it less attractive to camp out in our once-beautiful downtown.

This includes public transport and improvements to ABIA. The arts, cultural and affordability all must occur to support growth but we cannot continue to just let growth happen to us.

Figure out how to fix it, because the AISD board is too incompetent to do so.","Austin is a lovely city with so many opportunities, but traffic issues prevent many of us from enjoying those opportunities.","My biggest complaints are the woefully inadequate road improvements needed to keep up with city growth, the lack of affordable parking downtown and poor public transportation options. The current online options for city services are embarrassing for a tech city. And the skyrocketing costs of housing and property taxes which have pushed many of my friends out of Austin. Especially musicians which is seriously affecting our claim to the Live Music Capital.","Please remember what is critical to maintain Austin as a sustainable place to live. Please be cognizant that Austin is in a critical growth stage and any missteps that you make right now will impact Austin permanently. Austin must not loss its sense of self or of place.

Uphold the pillars of what has always made Austin amazing. That's what we all want.","I live in the Austin City limits, but don't feel I am part of Austin or welcomed any longer.  Mobility and access to areas is so restrictive due to traffic and events (that serve others) that prefer to stay away from downtown areas, central library and the town lake (Lady Bird) parks and trails.  Real fairness and equality issue at play here.  Should already be a major inter-connected light rail network in-place for a city this size with restricted geography and size of existing streets.","SLOW DOWN THE RAPID GROWTH IN EAST AUSTIN.  Growth is okay but it is being forced down our throats.","The city services I have used seem adequate, but East Austin is severely neglected. There aren't as many parks, libraries, etc. Access to emergency services takes longer. The landscaping is not attended as frequently. There are less grocery stores and restaurants. The traffic all over the city is terrible and keeps getting worse.","Raising a family in Austin is super difficult in this city. Our mortgage is way more of our combined income than is recommended by ficial experts, but we love the city and for now, we will scrape by and endure the chronic ficial stress in order to stay in the city my husband and I were raised in. Our family support network in Austin and it would be difficult to leave in that regard.","I love Austin!!!

Also, worry about Austin residents and not state and federal issues (immigration on border).","Try and do things the Texas way, not the California way.","Austin has been good to me and my family over the past 25 years.  Growth is exciting, but my neighbors and I share concerns about a loss in the quality of life due to the growth.  Improved, smart, greatly expanded public transportation options and policies that help people live in and stay in the City are critical to keeping Austin livable.  As property values sky-rocket, that again is exciting.  But those of us who do not want to cash out and leave are being pressured by high taxes.  And one by one, we watch our neighbors move out of the neighborhood replaced by investors who will never lay eyes on their investment much less become a part of the neighborhood.  Change is hard.  But people and quality of life  spurs Austin's growth too.  I sometimes worry that the City is more concerned about attracting big business here than about keeping us here.","I want to stay within the city and would love assistance on home buying that I qualify for with my income. I've been attempting however at this moment what I qualify for isn't exactly how I would like to live or they get taken by investors at cash or someone who can offer more than I can.

I'm fortunate to live close to work, but I actively avoid driving to the north side of the city unless absolutely necessary because traffic has become so bad.

Austin, unfortunately, is getting bigger so we need to figure out how to manage and plan for that growth now not in 5 or 10 years when it is too late.  We need to expand on what made Austin what it is today and not lose that through the growing pains.

I'd encourage the mayor and council as a whole to take rotating \"district field trips\" where they visit a different city council district and really drive around to check it out and also talk to residents.

No one more so than Mayor Adler, who sometimes seems not to live in the real world.","Reduce the influx of those trying to change the culture of our city.

Beyond that, I hope Austin will continue to be a diverse, welcoming, thriving, progressive city. We are already a positive example for the rest of Texas in many ways, but there is much work to do related to affordability, transportation, expanded opportunities for all, and integration (or at least connectivity between citizens and neighbors). Austin always has been and I hope will remain the best city in Texas!","Austin has beautiful natural resources.  To help the citizens enjoy the outdoors the city should control the mosquito population.  Each household is taking it upon themselves to curb the population. As a result each household is spraying many different chemicals into the air with little to no results.  There's got to be a better way.","Stop being so liberal.  We should not be competing with San Francisco.  My daughter lives there, but grew up in Austin.  No sanctuary city, please.  I took the time to answer your survey, then you ask for personal information at the end.  I don't know who access to this stuff.  Very disconcerting.","The exponential increase in the housing taxes for the city of Austin homeowners is simply unrealistic. I am paying mortgage here in housing tax than I used to pay in rent. This is not affordable living. I thought I would be saving money when I bought my home and now that is just not the case.","Promote city growth, but preserve unique culture and historic aspects of Austin as well as parks and recreation. Plan for traffic/city mobility. Get ahead of it. Find mass transit solutions for central Austin (elevated trains, light rail) and commuter rails between Austin and Houston, Dallas and San Antonio.","Telephone staff should be friendly and knowledgeable in order to help customers. If they don't know the answer, find someone who does; transfer the customer but give them the direct dial # should the connection be lost. Excellent telephone etiquette will introduce the City of Austin to new and existing citizens and a friendly voice goes a long way towards good relations.","I'm a Realtor and driving around Austin is difficult. I find myself stuck in traffic more and more. I understand that we have had a huge influx of people, but there should have been a plan in place for how to handle it. Turning road lanes into bike lanes is NOT the answer. Expecting people to somehow get to their metro stop that doesn't have parking and is too far to ride a bike is ridiculous.  I live in Great Hills. My Metro stop is at Kramer. Many people who live near me, work downtown and would be willing to take the Metro if there were a way to easily get there-or have a place to park their car.","please continue to seriously consider the environment when planning for Austin's future. more green spaces and more policies that incentives both residential and commercial, recycling and conservation of natural resources.  thank you","I ENJOY THE 10 ZONES IN AUSTIN.

It's only getting worse and the rich, out-of-towners who are just now moving here are the one's causing the inflation of everything here including tofu!  It's ridiculous.

In case you missed it before, I am an Austin native.  This actually used to be a nice place to live - years ago - but city administration has been so piss poor that there has been no master plan to keep this a nice place to live.  The developers own this city, and me an my fellow citizens have to pay for all the crap that they build with my tax dollars.  The condition of the roads is awful, traffic is awful.  I hate it here...........but I do have a plan to get out, and I will.  Don't ever give anyone in city administration a raise - they don't deserve it.  You do an awful job and should be ashamed.","Austin is a miserable excuse for a city. Everyone was asleep at the switch until the 1990s...no planning, no effort to see the future...and we were caught with our pants down for transportation and other infrastructure. Then the 90s came and greed/growth exceeded all else. Still no effort to improve transportation/infrastructure and the era of Will Wynn saw us give away the farm even more to developers. Now we're overcrowded and everything that was special about Austin - everything you've been selling to the outside world for 30 years is trashed. You can't go to Zilker Park anymore because it's been sold to special events most weekends of the year. And when you do go you have to pay to get in, pay to park. You can't go to the green belts or trails because they're just too crowded. Music is dying a rapid death because you put all the stinking condos downtown and decided the clubs were too loud, then the inflated land values doomed the nightclubs, and our ridiculous cost of living has further doomed the musicians. \"Live Music Capitol of the World\" is not just a joke, it's a downright lie. City government is directly responsible for destroying the music scene. And Code Compliance, Jesus, find that news report about Code Compliance showing up at that guy's house, in force, in kevlar vests, with cops in tow, all because he built a shed too close to the property line. And that insane response the city had to that poor schmuck who dug tunnels under his house. That's what Austin has become - taxes, ordinances, intrusion and suppression.","Need to be more inclusive of all races. The divide and lack or racial diversity is painful in Austin.

That diversity only happens with new people from different backgrounds moving in. This should be encouraged, not discouraged.","There are many things I have to say about the City of Austin but the one that most affects my daily life is the quality of roadways from E Riverside Dr heading south. Riverside Dr is in my opinion the worst road to drive on. Montopolis is in dire need of repaving from Grove to Ben White. The sidewalks need to be cleared & there are other trails that need tending to, not just the Lady Bird Lake Hike & Bike Trail. In other words, this entire area has been neglected, other than by contractors & developers.","quit worrying about state and national issues and work on things for Austin","Please focus on addressing inequality and public transportation within our city.

Thanks!","Stop building and ruining Austin.","Respect the residents and their needs instead of looking out of the city for more hair brained ideas for making Austin anything more than it is already.","Traffic- lack of roads, shut the gates to Austin, stop building.","It is so sad to see long time local business disappearing. We loved Austin because it was unique, and used to have the feeling of a small town with the advantages of a big city. Now, it is just another city in Texas with gas stations,  banks and Walgreen's on every corner of every rd. So sad to see Austin go down that rd!","STOP BUILDING ON EVERY CORNER.

AUSTIN IS NO MORE!","MAKE AUSTIN AFFORDABLE AND FOCUS ON MOBILITY.","AUSTIN IS BECOMING UNAFFORDABLE, HELP US FIND A WAY TO STAY HERE.","Do not let big business, extremely wealth people and the state dictate what is done for Austin.

Austin's traffic is becoming a real burden on its citizens and the lack of public transportation and lack of density will both make traveling across the city too burdensome, time-consuming. This will not only affect quality of living but also be bad for business. Please let's come up with incentives for the private sector to support the city in making public transportation a priority.","In spite of its tremendous growth spurt, Austin continues to be a beautiful and enticing city.  Would never live anywhere else but I am worried of the cost of living and the taxes since I getting to the point where I will be on a fixed income.","STOP WASTING MONEY. REDUCE PROPERTY TAX AND MAKE AUSTIN AFFORDABLE.","We need solutions to the high cost of living. They (the mayor and council) need to do more for the working class.  Instead of worrying about attracting more condo developers. Many of us born and raised here in Austin are hanging on by threads to afford our hometown.   That's not right.  They mayor and council are allowing the people and local businesses that made austin special beautiful and unique vanish .  They mayor and council have all shown they have sold our city out for the all mighty dollar.  And most importantly the mayor has made our city a disgusting filthy and unsafe place by allowing the homeless to overtake our formerly beautiful city.","Help the homeless so we can keep Austin clean.

In all of my 67 years in Austin I've never seen such filth.","THE RISING COSTS OF LIVING ARE PUSHING OUT SOME OF AUSTIN'S BEST RESIDENTS-FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN,PEOPLE OF COLOR, THE ELDERLY AND THE DISABLED.I CONSIDER MYSELF SUCCESSFUL AND FINANCIALLY STABLE BUT I DON'T SEE MYSELF ABLE TO AFFORD LIVING HERE IN THE FUTURE IF THINGS PROGRESS THE WAY THEY ARE NOW.","Make Austin's housing affordable, quit giving tax breaks and try to solve the traffic problem.","AUSTIN POLICE DEPT NEEDS TO VISIT THIS NEIGHBORHOOD MORE FREQUENTLY DAY AND NIGHT.","I wish I didn't think to myself, \"I liked Austin a lot more in the 1980's\", so often. Some things have improved, but many have worsened. I realize much is inevitable due to urban growth, but many cities across the globe have maintained their unique cultures despite their growth...I hope Austin can do it too.","REMEMBER AUSTIN HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FRIENDLY CITY.","STOP TELLING PEOPLE AUSTIN IS A PLACE TO LIVE","Traffic is the #1 problem and the lack of roads/highways.

I love that Austin is evolving, growing and has a ton of opportunity but we have to stop displacing families that have been here for generations. I've watched as the generation before me is forced to move to the suburbs and lose connections with lifelong friends and neighbors and access to this incredible city and all it has to offer. There has to be some way we can allow families to stay in their homes and co-exist with new neighbors. If there is way to sort of \"grandfather\" in property tax rates to residents that have lived in a house for a certain number of years it may help the problem of gentrification. The people moving in love authentic culture and food but also force out (probably unknowingly) the people who that culture belongs to.  Let's keep Austin welcoming for EVERYONE, not just for the new residents, but our native ones too.","Fixes residential streets that need it! Waste of money fixing South Congress and Otltort.

Stop giving them tax breaks since so much of Austin is used for state services and therefore do not pay any taxes.  At least until the city catches up with the current needs.

I value diverse jobs in areas that also pay the bills. I think this discomfort is happening everywhere and I don't know what y'all can do about it. No one has a good map on growing and no one wants to have the problems San Francisco and Seattle have. I know you're making the best choices you can with the information you have and I hope the advice is good advice regarding affordability and housing. So far I don't see more housing make it more affordable. I just see more unaffordable housing. When we have our 5% (not much) of units be affordable, do they remain affordable or can you then sell at market? City values aside, it's as though the economy does not want you here if you're poor.","Transition to homes for homeless on the street","Traffic congestion, affordable housing, and addressing the rapidly rising homeless population are top concerns and I know these are some of your top priorities as well. Allowing the open camping is causing safety issues, and litter issues. There is a routine homeless camp behind my home for years. Previously we have been able to clean out these camps to try to keep this water runoff critical area clear. I am worried about the effects of flooding (due to trash clogged creeks) and where this litter (including used needles) will run into. My cousin was assaulted before sunset downtown after leaving dinner over not handing over his phone to a homeless man. I don't vote against ballot initiatives to aid the homeless population. I think these types of initiatives would benefit from better awareness campaigns. The new rules allowing them to camp and trash the city and waterways is not a good option. I know we can't help those that don't want to be helped and there are no perfect answers for all but we have to have better options.","Property taxes are ridiculously high.","My heart is broken by your choices of growth, encouraging more than 1-2 tech companies to come here has destroyed the fabric of this very unique town.  Also allowing the homeless ordice to change prior to having a solution was so incredibly short sides and not what the people wanted makes us mistrust your intent.","More high quality museums and cultural centers","Mr. Mayor, while I'm sure your intentions are good, authorizing and endorsing homeless camps is bad policy, and is not any kind of acceptable solution to the city's homeless problem.  It is an abdication of responsibility, both to the individuals living in such conditions, and to the communities you serve, which deserve to be kept both safe and pleasant.  The nearby greenbelt area (Country Club Greenbelt), which should be a community jewel, is instead overrun with homeless encampments, and now, the city and parks officials who formerly worked with our community association to (humanely) remove and clean up homeless encampments say there is nothing they can do, because of the change in city policy.  The city is spending tens of millions to build paths from the area to Ladybird Lake; meantime, we can't get the city to remove mountains of trash, dangerous needles, and tent cities from the greenbelt and its paths and waterways.  Most of the well-intentioned but misguided policies the city has adopted to deal with the homeless problem are eerily similar to the failed policies of California and the Pacific Northwest, which area of the country we left for Austin, wrongly thinking that Texans had better common sense.  You should expect the same bad results.\nI have heard the Mayor say that he wants the city's homeless policies to be a model for other cities, to which I say, \"What policies?\"  The city is building a trivial amount of beds, slowly, and at great cost.  The few facilities you have in place are grossly inadequate and unsafe.  You need to partner with the private sector and let them build larger facilities, faster and cheaper than the city can, without all the red tape, aka San Diego tent breaks, which I'm sure you've heard of.  I realize there are no easy answers to these questions, but the city is moving in the wrong direction of endorsing community blighting encampments rather than addressing the homeless issue in any kind of effective way.  Recognize that when the only community input you seek on these homeless issues is 1-3 minute snippets at endless city council meetings, you are hearing from the extreme left, and not the regular citizens who must work during these marathon meetings, but who live and work in these communities, hold a very different point of view, and suffer the consequences of these misguided policies.  Unfortunately, a political environment has been created whereby any citizen who doesn't concur with the extreme left on issues of this nature, is treated with extreme disrespect in city forums, and, sadly, the Austin city council members tolerate it.  That is not democracy.  We all are legitimate voices in this city and ought to be able to work respectfully with one another towards solutions on homelessness and everything else this great city needs.","TOTAL WASTE TO SPEND 3 MILLION DOLLARS ON CODE CHANGES.

Councilman Renteria helped me get fencing from the Union Pacific RR -- $100k - 1500 square feet - running from Bannister Lane to Oltorf,  since rocks were being thrown into our home. It's a scary world with scary times. I applaud all you do for us and have always been a supporter. Yet, I do feel as though more needs to be done. Homeless camps by the Gillis Park are scary.

The Mayor seems to champion policies that work for him and others in his socio-economic status while enriching real estate professionals at the cost of us people earning less than $65K per year ... my quality of life is OK but I cannot travel, I cannot go out to eat at a restaurant that is more than $10, and I cannot afford to attend activities in our public park that are more than $5.

I am sympathetic to the plight of the homeless and am fully supportive of providing shelters to help them get cleaned up and off the streets.  But we have gone too far in allowing downtown to get overrun, just like San Francisco, San Jose, etc.  Eventually, people will no longer feel safe to go downtown, or the urine and feces will drive them away.  The City needs to develop a spine and take measures to make it less attractive to camp out in our once-beautiful downtown.

I believe that your performance management systems are ineffective and HR is driven more by fear of lawsuits than by common sense.","tone of the civic conversation in Austin has deteriorated; I hear more negative comments about the city than in the past; my personal interaction with city government less satisfactory - less transparency, difficult to get the information you want vs prepared presentations that city wants to provide","Public transportation is horribly insufficient. My neighborhood sidewalks are falling apart, causing injury to joggers. Not enough lighting. To many car and house break ins since building bridge over little Walnut Creek. Crime is up and another low income housing development is being built in our neighborhood against residents' wishes. This will be the second one in the last few years. Homeless people camping everywhere, makes it dangerous.","Gun control and background checks","If you want the citizens to speak to you, make time to listen even if you have to schedule several days to do so. We make time to speak up on things that are important to us.","Please, for the love of god, ban people from owning roosters within city limits.

They may protest everything but they believe in nothing. Stand your ground and do what's right for everyone not just the people that lie, cheat, and try to bully you into submission.","The City Council spends too much.","Make the downtown area safer. We have too many homeless people downtown and in Austin. I use to work downtown(until 2017) and walked on the sidewalks and around the lake and many times I did not feel safe. I had homeless guys follow me several times or yell at me. I do feel sorry for anyone that is homeless but it needs to be cleaned up.","Pay attention to our emergency services and personnel, respect them, and support them. Get the police a contract, build the fire stations we need, raise their wages. The city manager could take a pay cut to help that out.\nOne thing I'd like to ASK the mayor is how many of the city council, or Mayor himself, ever rides the bus? or rides a bike? I often wonder, especially when they advocate riding the bus or biking to work and spend so much time trying to get people out of cars and onto other transport. As I noted in a previous answer, I do ride the bus almost daily (and love the Rapid) but it is not practical for many to bus into work or to errands. I also like the Cap Metro services for those elderly or handicapped who can't walk to bus stops.","I wish the City still felt welcoming to it's residents.","Please do all you can to improve, keep strong, the relationship between law enforcement and our minority communities - make changes to protect those who live in our older, but now sought for property - do not tax these people OUT of our city!!!","hold people responsible for their areas of responsibility. if they fail to meet expectations, there should be financial penalties, suspensions or loss of employment.","Enforce rules against aggressive panhandlers.

I am concerned about affordability as I enter retirement. Thank you mayor Adler for your support of f fairness to all. I appreciate you.","Set up a special Internal Affairs division composed of retired veterans with honors in combat and conduct, to field COMPLAINTS about police, deputies, politicians, clergy, etc. and provide the public with competent oversight recourse if this division fails them. Recourse MUST enable the public to then make a permanent RECORD with the Governor's Office at own volition, NEVER BLOCKED in any way by Internal Affairs, and the record must come up for review by a grand jury for prospect of prosecution by an independent prosecutor..","I would tell Mayor Adler that I appreciate his support for the \"Freedom City\" initiative.","Coyotes are A MENACE.","I need to be educated on my city and how I can serve \nWhere would I go for a good general orientation?","Traffic is the 4th worst in the country, it needs professional services on how to manage. The soccer stadium needs to be built outside of the city.","Fix zoning","I am happy to live in such a culturally diverse and stimulating city.

We are starting to look like that. Not good    \nI would like to see the city provide designated spaces for camping.

I find myself stuck in traffic more and more. I understand that we have had a huge influx of people, but there should have been a plan in place for how to handle it.

Then the 90s came and greed/growth exceeded all else. Still no effort to improve transportation/infrastructure and the era of Will Wynn saw us give away the farm even more to developers. Now we're overcrowded and everything that was special about Austin - everything you've been selling to the outside world for 30 years is trashed. You can't go to Zilker Park anymore because it's been sold to special events most weekends of the year. And when you do go you have to pay to get in, pay to park. You can't go to the green belts or trails because they're just too crowded. Music is dying a rapid death because you put all the stinking condos downtown and decided the clubs were too loud, then the inflated land values doomed the nightclubs, and our ridiculous cost of living has further doomed the musicians. \"Live Music Capitol of the World\" is not just a joke, it's a downright lie.
