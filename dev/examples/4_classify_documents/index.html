Most<br>of the well-intentioned but<br>misguided policies the city has<br>adopted to deal with the<br>homeless problem are eerily<br>similar to the failed policies<br>of California and the Pacific<br>Northwest, which area of the<br>country we left for Austin,<br>wrongly thinking that Texans<br>had better common sense. You<br>should expect the same bad<br>results. I have heard the Mayor<br>say that he wants the city's<br>homeless policies to be a model<br>for other cities, to which I<br>say, \\\"What policies?\\\" The city<br>is building a trivial amount of<br>beds, slowly, and at great<br>cost. The few facilities you<br>have in place are grossly<br>inadequate and unsafe. You need<br>to partner with the private<br>sector and let them build<br>larger facilities, faster and<br>cheaper than the city can,<br>without all the red tape, aka<br>San Diego tent breaks, which<br>I'm sure you've heard of. I<br>realize there are no easy<br>answers to these questions, but<br>the city is moving in the wrong<br>direction of endorsing<br>community blighting encampments<br>rather than addressing the<br>homeless issue in any kind of<br>effective way. Recognize that<br>when the only community input<br>you seek on these homeless<br>issues is 1-3 minute snippets<br>at endless city council<br>meetings, you are hearing from<br>the extreme left, and not the<br>regular citizens who must work<br>during these marathon meetings,<br>but who live and work in these<br>communities, hold a very<br>different point of view, and<br>suffer the consequences of<br>these misguided policies.<br>Unfortunately, a political<br>environment has been created<br>whereby any citizen who doesn't<br>concur with the extreme left on<br>issues of this nature, is<br>treated with extreme disrespect<br>in city forums, and, sadly, the<br>Austin city council members<br>tolerate it.
