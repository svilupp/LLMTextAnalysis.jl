Each serves a different purpose in text analysis:</p><ul><li><strong><code>train_concept</code></strong>: Focuses on analyzing a single, specific concept within documents (eg, &quot;action-oriented&quot;)</li><li><strong><code>train_spectrum</code></strong>: Analyzes documents in the context of two opposing concepts (eg, &quot;optimistic&quot; vs. &quot;pessimistic&quot; or &quot;forward-looking&quot; vs. &quot;backward-looking&quot;)</li></ul><p>The resulting return types are <code>TrainedConcept</code> and <code>TrainedSpectrum</code>, respectively.

 &quot;I wish the City still felt welcoming to it&#39;s residents.&quot;
 &quot;The cost of living in Austin and the surrounding v areas is 100% absurd. Beyond ridiculous. I would do anything to have the \&quot;old Austin\&quot; back.&quot;
 &quot;When I was five, I told my Auntie \&quot;one day\&quot; I&#39;m going to move back to this city because I was born here and this is where I belong\&quot;. When I was 23 I did move back. Now I can&#39;t figure out why it meant so much to me. Why? Because this city has lost it&#39;s authenticity and now I&#39;m not sure why I would choose to stay. Please help me feel happy in my home.&quot;
 &quot;I&#39;m really sad about what Austin has become.  It used to feel like home.  Now, it just feels like a big, impersonal city with not much personality, and a lot of traffic (and high taxes).  The city that I loved is gone, which makes me sad and angry.&quot;
 &quot;Process to contest taxes was difficult, time consuming and unfair. Feels like city is not supportive.&quot;</code></pre><h2 id="Summarize-via-Plot"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Summarize-via-Plot">Summarize via Plot</a><a id="Summarize-via-Plot-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Summarize-via-Plot" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>Let&#39;s interactively explore our results.</p><p>We can use <code>plot</code> to plot the documents along the trained concepts and spectrums (simple scatter plot).

The nearby<br>greenbelt area (Country Club<br>Greenbelt), which should be a<br>community jewel, is instead<br>overrun with homeless<br>encampments, and now, the city<br>and parks officials who<br>formerly worked with our<br>community association to<br>(humanely) remove and clean up<br>homeless encampments say there<br>is nothing they can do, because<br>of the change in city policy.<br>The city is spending tens of<br>millions to build paths from<br>the area to Ladybird Lake;<br>meantime, we can't get the city<br>to remove mountains of trash,<br>dangerous needles, and tent<br>cities from the greenbelt and<br>its paths and waterways.

You<br>should expect the same bad<br>results. I have heard the Mayor<br>say that he wants the city's<br>homeless policies to be a model<br>for other cities, to which I<br>say, \"What policies?\" The city<br>is building a trivial amount of<br>beds, slowly, and at great<br>cost.

I<br>realize there are no easy<br>answers to these questions, but<br>the city is moving in the wrong<br>direction of endorsing<br>community blighting encampments<br>rather than addressing the<br>homeless issue in any kind of<br>effective way. Recognize that<br>when the only community input<br>you seek on these homeless<br>issues is 1-3 minute snippets<br>at endless city council<br>meetings, you are hearing from<br>the extreme left, and not the<br>regular citizens who must work<br>during these marathon meetings,<br>but who live and work in these<br>communities, hold a very<br>different point of view, and<br>suffer the consequences of<br>these misguided policies.<br>Unfortunately, a political<br>environment has been created<br>whereby any citizen who doesn't<br>concur with the extreme left on<br>issues of this nature, is<br>treated with extreme disrespect<br>in city forums, and, sadly, the<br>Austin city council members<br>tolerate it.

One thing I'd like to<br>ASK the mayor is how many of<br>the city council, or Mayor<br>himself, ever rides the bus? or<br>rides a bike?

Neither of which<br>are a living wage. Teachers are<br>paid less than retail store<br>managers. By ignoring this<br>problem we are screwing<br>ourselves in the long run.
