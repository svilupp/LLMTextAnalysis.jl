See ?aiembed for more details.\n\nReturns\n\nA TrainedSpectrum object containing the trained model (coeffs), along with other relevant information like the rewritten document (docs) and embeddings (embeddings).\n\nExample\n\n# Assuming `index` is an existing document index\nmy_spectrum = (\"pessimistic\", \"optimistic\")\nspectrum = train_spectrum(index, my_spectrum)\n\nShow the top 5 highest scoring documents for the spectrum 2 (spectrum.spectrum[2] which is \"optimistic\" in this example):\n\nscores = score(index, spectrum)\nindex.docs[first(sortperm(scores, rev = true), 5)]\n\n# Use rev=false to get the highest scoring documents for spectrum 1 (opposite end)\n\nYou can customize the analysis by passing additional arguments to the AI generation and embedding functions. For example, you can specify the model to use for generation and how many samples to use:\n\nspectrum = train_spectrum(index,\n    (\"forward-looking\", \"dwelling in the past\");\n    num_samples = 50, aigenerate_kwargs = (; model = \"gpt3t\"))\n\nThis function utilizes large language models to rewrite and analyze the text, providing insights based on the specified spectrum. The output includes embeddings and a model capable of projecting new documents onto this spectrum for analysis.\n\nFor troubleshooting, you can fit the model manually and inspect the accuracy:\n\nX = spectrum.embeddings'\n# First half is spectrum 1, second half is spectrum 2\ny = vcat(-1ones(length(spectrum.source_doc_ids)), ones(length(spectrum.source_doc_ids))) .|>\n    Int\naccuracy = cross_validate_accuracy(X, y; k = 4, lambda = 1e-8)\n\nOr explore the source documents and re-written documents:\n\n# source documents\nindex.docs[spectrum.source_doc_ids]\n\n# re-written documents\nspectrum.docs\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"api_reference/#LLMTextAnalysis.wrap_string","page":"References","title":"LLMTextAnalysis.wrap_string","text":"wrap_string(str::String,\n    text_width::Int = 20;\n    newline::Union{AbstractString, AbstractChar} = '\n\n')\n\nBreaks a string into lines of a given text_width.

The nearby<br>greenbelt area (Country Club<br>Greenbelt), which should be a<br>community jewel, is instead<br>overrun with homeless<br>encampments, and now, the city<br>and parks officials who<br>formerly worked with our<br>community association to<br>(humanely) remove and clean up<br>homeless encampments say there<br>is nothing they can do, because<br>of the change in city policy.<br>The city is spending tens of<br>millions to build paths from<br>the area to Ladybird Lake;<br>meantime, we can't get the city<br>to remove mountains of trash,<br>dangerous needles, and tent<br>cities from the greenbelt and<br>its paths and waterways.

You<br>should expect the same bad<br>results. I have heard the Mayor<br>say that he wants the city's<br>homeless policies to be a model<br>for other cities, to which I<br>say, \\\"What policies?\\\" The city<br>is building a trivial amount of<br>beds, slowly, and at great<br>cost.

It is an abdication of responsibility, both to the individuals living in such conditions, and to the communities you serve, which deserve to be kept both safe and pleasant.  The nearby greenbelt area (Country Club Greenbelt), which should be a community jewel, is instead overrun with homeless encampments, and now, the city and parks officials who formerly worked with our community association to (humanely) remove and clean up homeless encampments say there is nothing they can do, because of the change in city policy.  The city is spending tens of millions to build paths from the area to Ladybird Lake; meantime, we can't get the city to remove mountains of trash, dangerous needles, and tent cities from the greenbelt and its paths and waterways.  Most of the well-intentioned but misguided policies the city has adopted to deal with the homeless problem are eerily similar to the failed policies of California and the Pacific Northwest, which area of the country we left for Austin, wrongly thinking that Texans had better common sense.  You should expect the same bad results.\\nI have heard the Mayor say that he wants the city's homeless policies to be a model for other cities, to which I say, \\\"What policies?\\\"  The city is building a trivial amount of beds, slowly, and at great cost.  The few facilities you have in place are grossly inadequate and unsafe.  You need to partner with the private sector and let them build larger facilities, faster and cheaper than the city can, without all the red tape, aka San Diego tent breaks, which I'm sure you've heard of.  I realize there are no easy answers to these questions, but the city is moving in the wrong direction of endorsing community blighting encampments rather than addressing the homeless issue in any kind of effective way.  Recognize that when the only community input you seek on these homeless issues is 1-3 minute snippets at endless city council meetings, you are hearing from the extreme left, and not the regular citizens who must work during these marathon meetings, but who live and work in these communities, hold a very different point of view, and suffer the consequences of these misguided policies.  Unfortunately, a political environment has been created whereby any citizen who doesn't concur with the extreme left on issues of this nature, is treated with extreme disrespect in city forums, and, sadly, the Austin city council members tolerate it.

Most overpasses in the city look like homeless camps, and there seems to be a panhandler at almost every traffic light.  I've stopped visiting major cities in California because they have gotten so disgusting, and seldom go downtown at night now for the same reason.  I am sympathetic to the plight of the homeless and am fully supportive of providing shelters to help them get cleaned up and off the streets.  But we have gone too far in allowing downtown to get overrun, just like San Francisco, San Jose, etc.  Eventually, people will no longer feel safe to go downtown, or the urine and feces will drive them away.  The City needs to develop a spine and take measures to make it less attractive to camp out in our once-beautiful downtown.

I value diverse jobs in areas that also pay the bills. I think this discomfort is happening everywhere and I don't know what y'all can do about it. No one has a good map on growing and no one wants to have the problems San Francisco and Seattle have. I know you're making the best choices you can with the information you have and I hope the advice is good advice regarding affordability and housing. So far I don't see more housing make it more affordable. I just see more unaffordable housing.

Allowing the open camping is causing safety issues, and litter issues. There is a routine homeless camp behind my home for years. Previously we have been able to clean out these camps to try to keep this water runoff critical area clear. I am worried about the effects of flooding (due to trash clogged creeks) and where this litter (including used needles) will run into. My cousin was assaulted before sunset downtown after leaving dinner over not handing over his phone to a homeless man. I don't vote against ballot initiatives to aid the homeless population. I think these types of initiatives would benefit from better awareness campaigns. The new rules allowing them to camp and trash the city and waterways is not a good option. I know we can't help those that don't want to be helped and there are no perfect answers for all but we have to have better options.\",\"Property taxes are ridiculously high.\",\"My heart is broken by your choices of growth, encouraging more than 1-2 tech companies to come here has destroyed the fabric of this very unique town.

It is an abdication of responsibility, both to the individuals living in such conditions, and to the communities you serve, which deserve to be kept both safe and pleasant.  The nearby greenbelt area (Country Club Greenbelt), which should be a community jewel, is instead overrun with homeless encampments, and now, the city and parks officials who formerly worked with our community association to (humanely) remove and clean up homeless encampments say there is nothing they can do, because of the change in city policy.  The city is spending tens of millions to build paths from the area to Ladybird Lake; meantime, we can't get the city to remove mountains of trash, dangerous needles, and tent cities from the greenbelt and its paths and waterways.  Most of the well-intentioned but misguided policies the city has adopted to deal with the homeless problem are eerily similar to the failed policies of California and the Pacific Northwest, which area of the country we left for Austin, wrongly thinking that Texans had better common sense.  You should expect the same bad results.\\nI have heard the Mayor say that he wants the city's homeless policies to be a model for other cities, to which I say, \\\"What policies?\\\"  The city is building a trivial amount of beds, slowly, and at great cost.  The few facilities you have in place are grossly inadequate and unsafe.  You need to partner with the private sector and let them build larger facilities, faster and cheaper than the city can, without all the red tape, aka San Diego tent breaks, which I'm sure you've heard of.  I realize there are no easy answers to these questions, but the city is moving in the wrong direction of endorsing community blighting encampments rather than addressing the homeless issue in any kind of effective way.  Recognize that when the only community input you seek on these homeless issues is 1-3 minute snippets at endless city council meetings, you are hearing from the extreme left, and not the regular citizens who must work during these marathon meetings, but who live and work in these communities, hold a very different point of view, and suffer the consequences of these misguided policies.  Unfortunately, a political environment has been created whereby any citizen who doesn't concur with the extreme left on issues of this nature, is treated with extreme disrespect in city forums, and, sadly, the Austin city council members tolerate it.  That is not democracy.  We all are legitimate voices in this city and ought to be able to work respectfully with one another towards solutions on homelessness and everything else this great city needs.\",\"TOTAL WASTE TO SPEND 3 MILLION DOLLARS ON CODE CHANGES.

I often wonder, especially when they advocate riding the bus or biking to work and spend so much time trying to get people out of cars and onto other transport.

You do an awful job and should be ashamed.\",\"Austin is a miserable excuse for a city. Everyone was asleep at the switch until the 1990s...no planning, no effort to see the future...and we were caught with our pants down for transportation and other infrastructure. Then the 90s came and greed/growth exceeded all else. Still no effort to improve transportation/infrastructure and the era of Will Wynn saw us give away the farm even more to developers. Now we're overcrowded and everything that was special about Austin - everything you've been selling to the outside world for 30 years is trashed. You can't go to Zilker Park anymore because it's been sold to special events most weekends of the year. And when you do go you have to pay to get in, pay to park. You can't go to the green belts or trails because they're just too crowded. Music is dying a rapid death because you put all the stinking condos downtown and decided the clubs were too loud, then the inflated land values doomed the nightclubs, and our ridiculous cost of living has further doomed the musicians. \\\"Live Music Capitol of the World\\\" is not just a joke, it's a downright lie. City government is directly responsible for destroying the music scene. And Code Compliance, Jesus, find that news report about Code Compliance showing up at that guy's house, in force, in kevlar vests, with cops in tow, all because he built a shed too close to the property line. And that insane response the city had to that poor schmuck who dug tunnels under his house.
