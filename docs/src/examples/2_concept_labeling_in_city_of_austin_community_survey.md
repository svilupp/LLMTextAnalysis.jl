# Example 2: Label Arbitrary Concepts in the City of Austin Community Survey
For this tutorial, we will use the [City of Austin's Community Survey](https://data.austintexas.gov/Health-and-Community-Services/2019-City-of-Austin-Community-Survey/s2py-ceb7).

We will pick one open-ended question. Let's say we want to help the mayor to prioritize ideas,
so we will lay out the verbatims against the concepts of being "action-oriented" and "forward-looking".

You can choose any concepts that you want.

Necessary imports

````julia
using Downloads, CSV, DataFrames
import PlotlyJS, PlotlyDocumenter
using LLMTextAnalysis
````

## Prepare the Data
Download the survey data

````julia
Downloads.download("https://data.austintexas.gov/api/views/s2py-ceb7/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD",
    joinpath(@__DIR__, "cityofaustin.csv"));
````

Read the survey data into a DataFrame

````julia
df = CSV.read(joinpath(@__DIR__, "cityofaustin.csv"), DataFrame);
````

Let's select one of the open-ended questions, eg,

````julia
col = "Q25 - If there was one thing you could share with the Mayor regarding the City of Austin (any comment, suggestion, etc.), what would it be?"
docs = df[!, col] |> skipmissing |> collect;
````

## Build the Index
Index the documents (ie, embed them)

````julia
index = build_index(docs)
````

````
DocIndex(Documents: 2933, PlotData: None, Topic Levels: None)
````

Sometimes you know what you're looking for, but it's hard to define the exact keywords. For example, you might want to identify documents that are "action-oriented" or "pessimistic" or "forward-looking".

For these situations, `LLMTextAnalysis` offers two distinct functions for document analysis: `train_concept` and `train_spectrum`. Each serves a different purpose in text analysis:

- **`train_concept`**: Focuses on analyzing a single, specific concept within documents (eg, "action-oriented")
- **`train_spectrum`**: Analyzes documents in the context of two opposing concepts (eg, "optimistic" vs. "pessimistic" or "forward-looking" vs. "backward-looking")

The resulting return types are `TrainedConcept` and `TrainedSpectrum`, respectively. Both can be used to score documents on the presence of the concept or their position on the spectrum.

Why do we need `train_spectrum` and not simply use two `TrainedConcepts`? It's because opposite of "forward-looking" can be many things, eg, "short-sighted", "dwelling in the past", or simply "not-forward looking".

`train_spectrum` allows you to define the opposite concept that you need and score documents on the spectrum between the two.

## Score Documents against a Concept

Let's say we want to identify documents that are "action-oriented".
We can use `train_concept` to train a model to identify documents that are "action-oriented" and score the documents against the concept.

Let's show the top 5 documents that are most "action-oriented".

````julia
concept = train_concept(index,
    "action-oriented";
    aigenerate_kwargs = (; model = "gpt3t"))

scores = score(index, concept)
index.docs[first(sortperm(scores, rev = true), 5)]
````

````
5-element Vector{String}:
 "stop delaying important decisions and make the best one available and move on to solutions"
 "We need real transportation options, not just more lip service and endless studies that do not achieve implementation."
 "We need a comprehensive plan/vision for managing the growth of this city!"
 "The homeless problem is overwhelming for everyone. We MUST find solutions!"
 "we need to plan for global climate change, water and energy programs must be robust"
````

## Score Documents along a Spectrum

We may want to define an arbitrary "spectrum" (axis/polar opposites) and score documents on it.
Let's introduce a spectrum for "dwelling in the past" vs "forward-looking".
The higher the score (eg, 100%), the more "forward-looking" the document/text is.

Let's show the top 5 documents that are most "forward-looking".

````julia
spectrum = train_spectrum(index,
    ("dwelling in the past", "forward-looking");
    aigenerate_kwargs = (; model = "gpt3t"))

scores = score(index, spectrum)
index.docs[first(sortperm(scores, rev = true), 5)]
````

````
5-element Vector{String}:
 "MANAGING GROWTH IN A WAY THAT IMPROVES QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL CITIZENS"
 "Enhance affordability and ensure a diverse, healthy population."
 "LEAD IN HOW WE PLAN FOR GROWTH AND BECOME 100 PERCENT RELIABLE ON RENEWABLE ENERGY"
 "He is doing a great job. Setting planning for growth, transportation and mobility together is an excellent approach."
 "PLAN FOR ACCELERATED GROWTH. CLIMATE CHANGES PROMISES TO DELIVER MORE COASTAL CRISIS AND POPULATION DISPLACEMENT. AUSTIN WILL EXPAND AS A RESULT. THINK BIG. THANK YOU FOR PRIORITIZING SMART GROWTH AND A DENSE URBAN LANDSCAPE."
````

And how about the ones "dwelling in the past" (set `rev=false`)?

````julia
index.docs[first(sortperm(scores, rev = false), 5)]
````

````
5-element Vector{String}:
 "I wish the City still felt welcoming to it's residents."
 "The cost of living in Austin and the surrounding v areas is 100% absurd. Beyond ridiculous. I would do anything to have the \"old Austin\" back."
 "When I was five, I told my Auntie \"one day\" I'm going to move back to this city because I was born here and this is where I belong\". When I was 23 I did move back. Now I can't figure out why it meant so much to me. Why? Because this city has lost it's authenticity and now I'm not sure why I would choose to stay. Please help me feel happy in my home."
 "I'm really sad about what Austin has become.  It used to feel like home.  Now, it just feels like a big, impersonal city with not much personality, and a lot of traffic (and high taxes).  The city that I loved is gone, which makes me sad and angry."
 "Process to contest taxes was difficult, time consuming and unfair. Feels like city is not supportive."
````

## Summarize via Plot

Let's interactively explore our results.

We can use `plot` to plot the documents along the trained concepts and spectrums (simple scatter plot).
The positions of args `concept` and `spectrum` are important, as they determine the position of the concepts in the plot (x-axis, y-axis)

````julia
pl = PlotlyJS.plot(index, spectrum, concept;
    title = "Prioritizing Action-Oriented and Forward-Looking Ideas (Top-right Corner)")
````

The nearby<br>greenbelt area (Country Club<br>Greenbelt), which should be a<br>community jewel, is instead<br>overrun with homeless<br>encampments, and now, the city<br>and parks officials who<br>formerly worked with our<br>community association to<br>(humanely) remove and clean up<br>homeless encampments say there<br>is nothing they can do, because<br>of the change in city policy.<br>The city is spending tens of<br>millions to build paths from<br>the area to Ladybird Lake;<br>meantime, we can't get the city<br>to remove mountains of trash,<br>dangerous needles, and tent<br>cities from the greenbelt and<br>its paths and waterways.

You<br>should expect the same bad<br>results. I have heard the Mayor<br>say that he wants the city's<br>homeless policies to be a model<br>for other cities, to which I<br>say, \"What policies?\" The city<br>is building a trivial amount of<br>beds, slowly, and at great<br>cost.

I<br>realize there are no easy<br>answers to these questions, but<br>the city is moving in the wrong<br>direction of endorsing<br>community blighting encampments<br>rather than addressing the<br>homeless issue in any kind of<br>effective way. Recognize that<br>when the only community input<br>you seek on these homeless<br>issues is 1-3 minute snippets<br>at endless city council<br>meetings, you are hearing from<br>the extreme left, and not the<br>regular citizens who must work<br>during these marathon meetings,<br>but who live and work in these<br>communities, hold a very<br>different point of view, and<br>suffer the consequences of<br>these misguided policies.<br>Unfortunately, a political<br>environment has been created<br>whereby any citizen who doesn't<br>concur with the extreme left on<br>issues of this nature, is<br>treated with extreme disrespect<br>in city forums, and, sadly, the<br>Austin city council members<br>tolerate it.

One thing I'd like to<br>ASK the mayor is how many of<br>the city council, or Mayor<br>himself, ever rides the bus? or<br>rides a bike?

Neither of which<br>are a living wage. Teachers are<br>paid less than retail store<br>managers. By ignoring this<br>problem we are screwing<br>ourselves in the long run.
